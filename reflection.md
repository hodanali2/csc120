What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think what worked for me is understanding the purpose of the assignment and like actually taking time to break it down in parts and focus bit by bit. However, what did not work for me was appraoching the assignment with the mindset like I would get it done ervything one time but not taking breaks and understding if I actually understood what I am doing. My advice to anyone taking this course, be patient with yourself! you will feel you do not know what is going on but ask your peers, go to TA and office hours. Take advantage of all the resources given!
